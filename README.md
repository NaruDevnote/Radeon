Radeon is a multi-functional moderation bot with an anti-raid system! While still a small bot, it has a powerful and up-to-date moderation system with active development on the anti-raid system. Any and all support is appreciated!

## Contributions
If you want to contribute via suggestions, join Radeon's [**Support Server**](https://discord.gg/xcZwGhSy4G) to make one there or open an issue named "suggestion: \<name-here>" in this Github (without the `<>`).

Contributions via pull-requests should be made to the **dev** or **updates** branch, not the main branch. This is so that we can test the code first before pushing, and makes reverting files easier. :)

## Self-Hosting
We **do not** currently support self-hsoted instances. Please do not contact a maintainer requesting support for it.
